        Hi there, my name is Hammad Bin Arif and I love building things that
        make a difference. My journey into software engineering started at the
        age of 13, when I discovered the MIT Companion app and built my very
        first app... and I kind of got hooked!

        I've always been fascinated by the potential of technology to solve
        real-world problems, and that's what led me to pursue computer science
        in both my education and career. But my interests go beyond just
        <span className="text-blue-400"> software development.</span>
      </motion.p>
      <motion.p
        variants={fadeIn("", "", 0.1, 1)}
        className="mt-4 text-secondary text-[17px] max-w-3xl leading-[30px]"

        In fact, I also started my own{" "}
        <span className="text-blue-400"> advertising agency</span>, where I had
        the opportunity to work with a range of clients and gain valuable
        experience in project management, marketing, and design. I'm also
        passionate about finance and frequently trade stocks and explore{" "}
        <span className="text-blue-400"> Algo trading</span> using my own AI
        bots.
      </motion.p>

        My other half is in deep interest for{" "}
        <span className="text-blue-400">space and quantum physics</span>, which
        is why I'm pursuing it as a subject in university aswell. Combining all
        of these experiences and interests, I'm excited to continue creating
        meaningful products and solutions that make a{" "}
        <span className="text-blue-400">positive impact on the world.</span>
      </motion.p>

      <div className="mt-20 flex flex-wrap gap-10">
        {services.map((service, index) => (
          <ServiceCard key={service.title} index={index} {...service} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
